## How to run

### development mode

## Improvements
- [ ] Use a Linter
- [ ] Add Unit test
- [ ] Add PropTypes for each component
- [ ] Use env files to manage the API Keys
- [ ] Use some CSS pre processor (I did not consider it necessary since the project is small)
- [ ] Make a better abstraction of the connections to the sockets to keep the views separate from this logic
